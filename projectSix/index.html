  <center><b><p class="first">Dennis Ritchie, the software developer who brought the world the C programming language and Unix operating system, has died at the age of 70.Ritchie (known by the username "dmr") was part of a dynamic software development duo with Ken Thompson at Bell Labs, which they joined in 1967 and 1966, respectively.Ritchie created the C programming language, which replaced the B programming language Thompson invented.The two later went on to create Unix, initially for minicomputers and written in assembly language, in 1969, and written in C in 1973.Unix went on to become key software for critical computing infrastructure around the world, though wasn't for everyone.Ritchie once said: "UNIX is very simple, it just needs a genius to understand its simplicity." Unix , of course, became the inspiration for newer operating systems including Linux and Apple's iOS. </b></p>
